## Start Project

1=> In your project directory open CMD/Terminal and type command `npm install` to install dependencies 

2=> Run `shopify theme dev --store="Store myshopify.com line here"` in CMD/Terminal to create a new preview theme and preview it locally

**NOTE** The store flag here is needed for first time so shopify CLI knows where store to work with. You can check store name with `shopify theme info` command. After setting up a new project this command can also be used as `shopify theme dev`(without store flag) or `npm run dev`. The second one is defined under scripts in package.json file and more commands can be added here as well including commands to install private packages(libraries) to run them directly with  npm run prefix in terminal. Visit this [guide](https://github.com/C2Digital1/c2-theme/blob/main/Shopify-CLI.md) for more info on package.json scripts and how to use them for private packages.

`git add .` Stage All changes

`git commit -m "Commit Name here(can be feature name)"` Add a commit 

`git push c2 [Your branch name]` Push this new commit to Github repo.

## Keep your local theme up-to-date with Main branch for future changes

3=> First make sure you do not have any staged changes by using command `git stash` to delete all staged changes

4=> Than type `git pull c2 main` to pull everything from main branch. The `c2` here refers to the repo origin main so make sure to change it in case you used a different name.

5=> Resolve any conflicts(if any) and now you can go  ahead with making your new changes.

6=> After all changes are done, You can follow **PUSH CHANGES** instructions to push the new changes again to your remote branch.
